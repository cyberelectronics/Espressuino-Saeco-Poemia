This version was modified for Poemia (only PID and Steam Temperature INIT value modifications in espressuino.pde file). 

Note: 
Will work with Poemia or any other espresso machine, just change the P-I-D values and steam temperature.
"Electrovalve output" can be left unconnected if your espresso machine doesn't have such component (the software will work anyway).


Espressuino v3.0 --- 08.10.13

Compatible Hardware version 1.2
Not compatible with Hardware version 1.1

Added: - Volumetric measurement on 2 different (shared) buttons (AV1(S2) and AV2(S1), in Auto Mode).
       - 2 different (shared buttons) Shot duration Timers for Auto Time Mode (AT1(S2) and AT2(S1))

Added: - Automatic Descale Function
         Can be turned ON by pressing the Espresso/Steam button, then turn ON the machine, until the Descale Mode message will appear on the LCD
         "Dscl" on the LCD shows the boiler temperature while descaling, and "Drem" shows how many descale cycles remains.
         In the software we can set: - temperature LOW/HIGH (default 40C/90C)
                                     - delay after the first boiler preheat (default 0 minutes)
                                     - Pump Turn ON time, to obtain 180-200ml water (default 21 seconds)
                                     - delay between cycles (default 15 minutes)
                                     - number of cycles (default 1, the first decalcifier load cycle always already included)
         You can stop and start the Automatic process anytime (only in Descale Mode), by pressing the Auto/Manual button.
         You can stop and start Manually the pump anytime, by pressing the Start/Stop button (this also will Stop the Automatic process)
         Just turn OFF the machine to exit from Descale Mode. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Espressuino v1.8 --- 05.09.13

Added: - Flush - Keep pressed the Start/Stop button. The pump will turn On for 1 second, then will turn Off automatically.
       - Improved Preinfusion - Now it is possible to set the Pump ON time (pulse)
                              - One cycle duration (period, ON+OFF time)
                              - Number of cycles do you want to skip after preinfusion pulses
                              - Keep the 3way valve Activated or Deactivated (to release the pressure from portafilter, after preinfusion pulses)
       - Power Save Mode - The heater will be turned OFF automatically, after a preset period, if no button pressed.
       - Improved pressure measurement stability, using average datas.

All important values can be set in the software from the main page.          

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Espressuino v1.7 --- 02.09.13

- Added: 
        - 3 way ElectroValve control
        Now it is possible to use all the previously implemented functions (Preinfusion and AutoFill-up) on Gaggia Classic.    
- Modified: 
          There was a problem with using PB5 for electrovalve. This pin is always activated at startup by the bootloader, for a fraction of a second. 
          So I connected the Electrovalve control to PB1 and the Buzzer to PB5.

Special For Poemia


Espressuino v1.6 --- 23.08.13

Added: Grinder Timer Mode for controlling your Grinder Power ON time 
       (using a Fotek SSR-40-DA controlled from P2 connector pin 1-GND and pin 5-PB2 output, from AUX connector)
       
       Now there is 3 main modes (using Espresso/Steam/Grinder button):
       1) Espresso Mode
       2) Steam Mode
       3) Grinder Mode
    
    a) Select Grinder Mode and push the Start/Stop button on Espressuino board, to start the timer and your grinder.
       You can stop and start again the grinder, anytime, pushing the Start/Stop button again.

    b) You can start the Grinder instantly by pressing the Esp/Stm/Grd button for 2 seconds.
       The grinder will be started only once (for the preset time), then the Espresso Mode will be selected automatically.

       The grinder can be stopped anytime ( a),b) ), using the Start/Stop button. 
  
       The timer value can be set in Settings Mode.  

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Espressuino v1.5 --- 07.08.13

- Removed: Sound ON/OFF option from settings and main (now can be turned ON/OFF only from the sketch)
- Added: Software Pressure Control function, for setting the desired pressure value in the software, 
         controlling the Ulka Vibration Pump. For this we need a pressure transducer (0.5V to 4.5V - 15bar and R5 must Not Connected),
         without it the pressure detector pin (P4 pin 10) must be tied to GND and then the pump will work at full power
         all the time)
- Added: AutoFill function for the boiler while steaming (useful only when longer steam possibility needed). 
         Default: Deactivated. Can be activated with "steampump_activate=1".   
- Bug fix: When Preheat Delay activated, this doesn't stop while we are in Settings mode

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Espressuino v1.4 --- 25.07.13

- Changed: Thermistor value from 10K to 100K for better resolution at higher temperatures (0.1C at 95C), 
           using EPCOS - B57560G104F - THERMISTOR 100K 1%  

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Espressuino v1.3 --- 05.06.13

- added: changing the P value (PID) while the Pump is ON. This will keep the heater almost at Full Power until 
the Pump is ON and the boiler temp. is under the Set Temp Value. Useful for espresso machines with small boiler. 
Drawback: There will be an overshoot, after turning the Pump Off.
This function can be turned Off by changing the "PUMP_PID" value from 1 to 0, in the source code.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Espressuino v1.2 --- 29.05.13

- added: Delay function (Dxx on LCD) for Group preheat (from 0 to 99 minutes) 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Espressuino v1.1 --- 28.05.13

- small bug fix for Sound when steaming  
- added: Sound ON (SON) and Sound OFF (SOF) function in menu for buzzer 
- added: changing P value (PID) while steaming, for reaching steam temperature quickly (thermostat mode) 
- added: temperature and PID initialization in EEPROM for the first run (after programming the bootloader).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Espressuino v1.0 

- after first run, the circuit must be connected to the PC for temperature and PID init in EEPROM, 
using BBCC Plotter (press "R" for init, case sensitive)
